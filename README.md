# Work Day Scheduler

##Description
Do you ever fall into a hole at work and completely lose track of time? Are you ever late to meetings or letting tasks fall to the wayside for more pressing matters? Keep an eye on your workday with this scheduler! The time will update and turn red if you have a project coming due soon. It will also grey out any time that has already lapsed, giving you a visual of the time left in your workday.
